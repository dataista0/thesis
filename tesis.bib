  abstract = {{Many applications in information extraction, natural language understanding, information retrieval require an understanding of the semantic relations between
entities. We present a comprehensive review of various aspects of the entity relation extraction task. Some of the most important supervised and semi-supervised
classiﬁcation approaches to the relation extraction task are covered in sufﬁcient
detail along with critical analyses. We also discuss extensions to higher-order relations. Evaluation methodologies for both supervised and semi-supervised methods are described along with pointers to the commonly used performance evaluation datasets. Finally, we also give short descriptions of two important applications
of relation extraction, namely question answering and biotext mining.}},

  abstract = {Semantic Similarity relates to computing the similarity between concepts which are not lexicographically similar. We investigate approaches to computing semantic similarity by mapping terms (concepts) to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that ontology. Some of the most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet as the underlying reference ontology. Building upon the idea of semantic similarity, a novel information retrieval method is also proposed. This method is capable of detecting similarities between documents containing semantically similar but not necessarily lexicographically similar terms. The proposed method has been evaluated in retrieval of images and documents on the Web. The experimental results demonstrated very promising performance improvements over state-of-the-art information retrieval methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore the power of surface text patterns for open-domain question answering systems. In order to obtain an optimal set of patterns, we have developed a method for learning such patterns automatically. A tagged corpus is built from the Internet in a bootstrapping process by providing a few hand-crafted examples of each question type to Altavista. Patterns are then automatically extracted from the returned documents and standardized. We calculate the precision of each pattern, and the average precision for each question type. These patterns are then applied to find answers to new questions. Using the TREC-10 question set, we report results for two cases: answers determined from the TREC-10 corpus and from the web.},
